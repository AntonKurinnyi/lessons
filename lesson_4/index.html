			<h2>
				What started as one man selling components out of a trailer has become a behemoth of the bike industry.
				Here's how
			</h2>
			<p>Like many successful brands, Specialized’s story is one of entrepreneurship and capitalism, but this one
				comes with a leftfield twist.</p>
			<p>As a young man fresh out of university in 1973, Mike Sinyard sold his Volkswagen Camper van to raise enough
				money to fly to Europe and ride around on his bike. After spending some time in Italy he met Cino Cinelli,
				founder of the eponymous Italian bike company.</p>

			<h2>Thick and thin</h2>
			<p>Not that it has been plain sailing for Specialized throughout the 45 years it has been in business. On
				occasions, costly investments would prove to be non-starters, and according to Sinyard himself the brand
				came within a few hundred dollars of bankruptcy in the mid-1990s.</p>
			<p>‘Rodney Hines, one of our graphic designers and a Specialized veteran of more than 30 years, started
				slapping these “Innovate or Die” stickers around our HQ in the 1990s because he thought we were getting a
				bit soft,’ says Cote. ‘We really took that to heart and still use that slogan to this day because it
				resonated – if we aren’t differentiating and driving innovation, why are we around?’</p>

		<div class="history__three">
			<h2>Changing gear</h2>
			<p>The past couple of years have seen some seismic shifts in the road market but it only takes a brief bit of
				research to see that Specialized is handily placed within each niche.</p>
			<p>A case in point is the Tarmac – it has a reasonable claim to have pioneered the blueprint for a modern road
				race bike and many competitors have since released machines with similar features.</p>
			<p>‘We’d been treading the same path with the Tarmac for several iterations so with the SL6 we took a step back
				to see what other avenues we could go down,’ says Cam Piper, Specialized’s road product manager for the
				Tarmac and Venge.</p>

		<div class="future">
			<h2>New horizons</h2>
			<p>Cote says that while naysayers may claim that the road scene is tapering off, Specialized believes that
				worldwide it is still as vibrant as ever. That said, the brand is focussed heavily on gravel and e-road too.
			</p>
			<p>‘We just can’t get enough of how forward-thinking and experimental gravel riding is,’ he says. ‘The future
				is really open for gravel and it’s one of our biggest areas of investment.’</p>
			<p>‘We opened an e-bike hub in Switzerland seven years ago, which now has 40 employees,’ says Cote. ‘The Creo
				is my favourite bike of ours without doubt.</p>
